If you run arch or an arch based distro, you may wanna install `aur/python-neovim-git` to get functionality of YCM and vimspector.
Get in nvim and run `:PlugInstall` and :`GoInstallBinaries`.
When cloning this repo, head to `$HOME.config/nvim/autoload/plugged/YouCompleteMe/` and run `python install.py` to compile YCM for use.
